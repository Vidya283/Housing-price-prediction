# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction

Predictive Modeling of California Housing Prices (using machine learning and data visualization technique)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores the California Housing dataset to identify and understand the key factors influencing housing prices using statistical analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling. It applies machine learning models to predict home values based on demographic and geographic features.The goal is to predict housing prices by training and evaluating various algorithms to identify the best-performing model.
